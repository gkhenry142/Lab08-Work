            Wichita is my hometown. Until leaving to study at the University of Kansas, I lived my whole life in Wichita.</br>
            It may not have as many cool things to do as in Kansas City, but I still think it is a great place to raise a family.</br>
            Although the town is bustling with people, the street and highway traffic never gets as bad as it does in Kansas City.</br>
            Also, my home is only 5-10 minutes away from the grocery store, the movie theater, the gym, the library, and my high school.</br>
            The cost of living is also reasonable, which makes it a great city to start a career and accumulate wealth for retirement.</br>
